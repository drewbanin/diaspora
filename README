# Diaspora (wip)

### Hypothesis:
The human diaspora out of Africa can be modeled with cellular automata.

### Metrics:
[ ] % of land explored
[ ] % of land settled
[ ] relationship between technological advancements and land explored

### Ideas
- Types of cells: settlers, explorers
- settlers tend to stay still (maximize density per tile)
- explorers tend to venture out (minimize density per tile)
- some regions are more habitable than others
- coasts, rivers, grassy areas are hospitable
- mountains, deserts, oceans are inhospitable
- map is covered by fog until it is explored
- cells can relay their maps of the world to other cells
- p(explore) ‚àù tech points + population density + num explorers present
- population accrues tech points over time
- tech points grow exponentially (kind of) -- slow at first then fast later
