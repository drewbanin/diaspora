ok so here's the deal -- need to make a graph of this shit

HERE'S A COOL STACK!
  - WRITE A PYTHON PROGRAM TO WRITE OUT A GRAPH IN A JSON FILE
  - THE FORMAT FOR THE JSON FILE SHOULD BE

{
  nodes: [
            {id: ~, position: {...} , features: {...},
            {id: ~, position: {...} , features: {...},
            ...
        ],
  edges: [
    {from: node_a_id, to: node_b_id, cost: ~~~},
    {from: node_a_id, to: node_b_id, cost: ~~~},
    ...
  ]
}

That would be cool


So the stack:
  Make a ruby on rails app which lets you upload a map
  Then pick colors for shits
  Then run simulations with customizable vars!



TODO : 
  - set up a rails environment
  - make a page to upload images
  - make it so you can assign color ranges to features
  - run the sim with configurable options!!
  - so fucking cool
